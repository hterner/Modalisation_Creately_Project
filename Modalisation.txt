 In order to establish a few sample business processes, we have selected  the most common operations carried out by the rental service company Voyage Auto:

● Sales revenue: the company is interested in the performance of its revenue obtained from the rental of vehicles.
● Customer service: the company wants to know the level of satisfaction during and after the sales process as well as the commitment of its customers.

Business process: 
According to the KImball method we represent the business process at the lower level, so we say that the simplest process of our sales model is the processing of reservations of vehicles. This process is typically supported for VoyageAuto's reservation system and generates or produces Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be used to build our fact table.

Grain: 
As the grain represents the level of detail of the simplest or atomic data, in our case, the most granular data is a reserved vehicle in VoyageAuto's reservation system.

Identify the dimensions 

● Vehicle Dimension with hierarchy attributes of make, model, color, year (of manufacture), mileage, availability and condition of the rental vehicle are required to describe the vehicle and provide full details.
● Date dimension, with hierarchy attributes date, month, quarter, year are needed to display, for example, the promotion start date and the end date of a booking, promotion, etc.
● Reservation dimension, with typical attributes  of reservation and type of incidents that take place during the rental, as the remaining descriptive fields in a reservation process in the company's system.
● Customer dimension, with  typical attributes like customer ID, name, address
● Branch Dimension, with hierarchy attributes of Branch ID, Branch Name and Address, Provincial Company ID, Company Name, and so on. This gives all the information about a large number of branches covering each of the provinces and the several provincial companies but also represents the starting and ending points of a reservation.
● Dimension Promotion, apparently a significant portion of revenue comes from promotion on its regular rates.,with descriptive attributes such as name or promotion code we can analyze, for example, under which promotion a vehicle has been reserved.

Identify the fact table
This step involves answering the following questions:

1) Was the promotion profitable? 
In other words, if the number of reservations has increased over the last year?
2) Were there any branches that rented more vehicles in the past year?
3) Who are the top 5 customers who have made the most reservations? 
How much does this represent in total overview?
4) Which vehicle brand made the highest profit?
5) What is the primary location of these people (customers) renting online?
6) Whether the products on promotion showed a drop in rental just before or after the promotion thus nullifying any gain.
7) How much do we make on rental in the last fiscal year? How does this compare to the last 2 years?
8) Which types of reservations are most used: by counter, by telephone or by internet? 
Which generates less profit?
